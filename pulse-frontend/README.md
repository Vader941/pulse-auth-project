**Pulse** is a dynamic, personalized web app that delivers daily utility in a clean, modular format. Designed for modern users aged 20–35, it features quick access to essentials like weather, news, and entertainment — all in a sleek, two-column layout that mimics flipping to your favorite section in a newspaper.

Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a component-driven approach, Pulse is part of an ongoing effort to blend utility, interactivity, and personalization.
